# SQL Internship - Task 3: Basic SELECT Queries (MySQL)

# About the Task
In this task, I worked on writing basic SQL `SELECT` queries using MySQL. The goal was to practice how to retrieve data from one or more tables in a structured database and apply different filters and sorting techniques.

# Database Used
I used the **RentalDB** database, which is designed to manage information related to rental properties. It includes tables like:

- Locations
- Owners
- Properties
- Renters
- Bookings
- Payments

These tables are connected through relationships and include real-world data like property details, rental bookings, payment records, and user contacts.

# What I Did
I wrote several SQL queries to explore and retrieve data from different tables. Hereâ€™s what I covered:

- Selected all columns from a table using `SELECT *`
- Retrieved specific columns like names and emails from the `Renters` table
- Filtered records using `WHERE` with conditions like `AND`, `OR`
- Used pattern matching with `LIKE`
- Applied `BETWEEN` to filter results within a specific range
- Sorted results using `ORDER BY` (both ascending and descending)
- Limited the number of output rows using `LIMIT`

These queries helped me understand how to extract useful information from a database in different scenarios.
